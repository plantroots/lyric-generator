# Lyric Generator

This repository contains a notebook that builds a simple RNN with Tensorflow that is trained on the whole Beatles lyrics corpus.
It tries to predict the next word for a given sequence of words.

Some samples:
```
When in doubt --> When in doubt think of love
Crying --> Crying for the day
I don't know why --> I don't know why you say goodbye
```
